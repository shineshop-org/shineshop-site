# Content Synchronization Fix

## Issue Fixed

We've addressed the discrepancy between your local development environment and the deployed version of the site. The specific issues fixed were:

1. The hero title/subtitle (gradient text) not updating
2. Tag labels (such as "Đăng ký" vs "Giải trí")
3. TOS and FAQ content not matching between environments

## Root Cause

The issue stemmed from how data is handled in the two different environments:

- **Development mode**: Uses dynamic data from `data/store-data.json`, accessed via API endpoints
- **Production mode**: Uses static data from `app/lib/initial-data.ts`, which wasn't being properly updated

## What We Fixed

1. **API Endpoint Enhancement**: Updated the `/api/dev/update-file` endpoint to properly transfer all content from the store-data.json file to the initial-data.ts file.

2. **Store Initialization**: Enhanced the Zustand store to properly use the initial data values in production mode.

3. **Missing Exports**: Added missing exports for initialPaymentInfo, initialLanguage, and initialTheme.

4. **User Guidance**: Improved the confirmation message when publishing to make it clear what's being updated.

## How to Use the "Publish to Production" Feature

1. Make all your content changes in the admin dashboard
2. Verify they look correct in your local environment
3. Click the "Publish to Production" button
4. Confirm the action
5. Wait for GitHub and Cloudflare to complete the deployment (usually a few minutes)

## Important Notes

1. **Data Flow**: 
   - Admin dashboard updates → store-data.json (for local testing) 
   - When publishing → initial-data.ts → deployed static site

2. **Verify Deployment**: After publishing, check your Cloudflare dashboard to verify the deployment completed successfully.

3. **Test After Deployment**: Always verify that your changes appear correctly on the deployed site.

## Technical Details

The fixed code now ensures that:
- All content including hero titles, subtitles, category names, and TOS/FAQ is properly transferred to the static file
- The store initializes correctly in both development and production modes
- Error handling is improved to prevent data loss
